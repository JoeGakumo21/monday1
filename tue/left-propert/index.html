        <h1>The Left Property</h1>
        <p>You can see that when an element's position is set to relative</p>
        <div id="relative">
            <p>It can move in any direction relative to its original position.</p>
            <p>A little bit this way</p>
            <p>And that.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>The Right Property (Obviously not the wrong one)</h1>
        <div>
            <p>I am just here to give some perspective.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="rel">
            <p>In the previous lesson, elements moved away from the left.</p>
            <p>But it's the opposite here.</p>
            <p>We move away from the right.</p>
            <p>So we're always wrong.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>We on the other hand are always on the right side of things</p>
            <em>Puns galore.</em>

        <div id="main">
            <h1>Top property</h1>
            <div id="relative">
                <p>When we use the top property, the element can move away or towards the top.</p>
            </div>
            <p>You can move an element down enough to block content of another element</p>
